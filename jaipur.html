        <h2>üèõ History of Jaipur</h2>
        <p>Jaipur was established in <strong>1727</strong> by <strong>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II</strong>, a visionary
            ruler and an expert in astronomy and architecture. Before Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan was

            decided to build a new city.</p>

        <p>Unlike many Indian cities, Jaipur was a <strong>planned city</strong>, designed according to a <strong>Vastu Shastra</strong> and
