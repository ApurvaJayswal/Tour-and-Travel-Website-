        <p>The Ajanta Caves, located in Maharashtra, are among the most remarkable examples of ancient Indian rock-cut

        <h2>History of Ajanta Caves</h2>

            1st century CE), saw the construction of early Buddhist monasteries. The second phase, during the Vakataka
            period (5th century CE), brought more elaborate caves with detailed frescoes and sculptures. Over time,
            these caves were abandoned and remained hidden until their rediscovery in 1819 by a British officer.</p>
